
> In large language models (LLMs), data parallelism and model parallelism are often used together to train the model efficiently. Data parallelism involves splitting the training data across multiple devices and updating the model parameters in parallel, while model parallelism involves splitting the model itself across multiple devices and performing computations in parallel. By combining these two parallelization techniques, it is possible to scale training to very large models and datasets.

> Scaling laws for pre-training large language models consider
- Model size: Number of parameters
- Dataset size: Number of tokens
- Batch size: Number of samples per iteration
- Compute budget: Compute constraints
  <br>
 to maximize the performance of a model within a set of constraints and available scaling choices.


> Increasing the model size is one way to potentially improve performance, but it is not the only factor that affects model performance. Other factors such as dataset size, quality of data, training duration, optimization techniques, and hyperparameter tuning also play a crucial role in improving model performance. In some cases, increasing the model size may not necessarily lead to better performance and can even introduce issues like overfitting. It is important to carefully consider all aspects of model training and optimization to achieve the best performance, rather than solely relying on increasing the model size.
