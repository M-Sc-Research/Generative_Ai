Generative AI is a subset of traditional machine learning. 
<br>
The machine learning models that underpin generative AI have learned these abilities by finding statistical patterns in massive datasets of content that was originally generated by humans.
<br>
Large language models have been trained on trillions of words over many weeks and months and with large amounts of computing power. These foundation models, as we call them, with billions of parameters, exhibit emergent properties beyond language alone, and researchers are unlocking their ability to break down complex tasks, reason, and problem-solve.
<br>
The more parameters a model has, the more memory, and as it turns out, the more sophisticated the tasks it can perform. By either using these models as they are or by applying fine-tuning techniques to adapt them to your specific use case, you can rapidly build customized solutions without the need to train a new model from scratch.<br>
The way you interact with language models is quite different than other machine learning and programming paradigms. In those cases, you write computer code with formalized syntax to interact with libraries and APIs.
<br>

> In contrast, large language models can take natural language or human written instructions and perform tasks much as a human would. The text that you pass to an LLM is known as a **prompt**.

<br>
The space or memory that is available to the prompt is called the context window, and this is typically large enough for a few thousand words but differs from model to model.
<br>

In this example, you ask the model to determine where Ganymede is located in the solar system. The prompt is passed to the model, the model then predicts the next words, and because your prompt contained a question, this model generates an answer. The output of the model is called a **completion**, and the act of using the model to generate text is known as **inference**.

<br>
<br>

> The completion is comprised of the text contained in the original prompt, followed by the generated text. You can see that this model did a good job of answering your question. It correctly **identifies** that Ganymede is a moon of Jupiter and generates a reasonable answer to your question stating that the moon is located within Jupiter's orbit.
<br>

 You can use LLMs to carry out smaller, focused tasks like **information retrieval**. In this example, you ask the model to identify all of the people and places identified in a news article. This is known as named entity recognition, a word classification.

 <br>
 <br>
 
  The understanding of knowledge encoded in the model's parameters allows it:
  1. to correctly carry out this task
  2. return the requested information
  3.  Finally, an area of active development is augmenting LLMs by connecting them to external data sources or using them to invoke external APIs.
  4.   You can use this ability to provide the model with information it doesn't know from its pre-training and to enable your model to power interactions with the real world.
  <br>
  
 > Developers have discovered that as the scale of foundation models grows from hundreds of millions of parameters to billions, even hundreds of billions, the subjective understanding of language that a model possesses also increases. This language understanding stored within the parameters of the model is what processes, reasons, and ultimately solves the tasks you give it, but it's also true that smaller models can be fine-tuned to perform well on specific focused tasks.

It's important to note that generative algorithms are not new. Previous generations of language models made use of an architecture called **recurrent neural networks** or RNNs. RNNs while powerful for their time, were limited by the amount of compute and memory needed to perform well at generative tasks.
</p>

example of an RNN:
- carrying out a simple next-word prediction generative task
-  With just one previous word seen by the model, the prediction can't be very good.
-   As you scale the RNN implementation to be able to see more of the preceding words in the text, you have to significantly scale the resources that the model uses.
<br>

- As for the prediction, the model failed here. Even though you scale the model, it still hasn't seen enough of the input to make a good prediction.
-  To successfully predict the next word, models need to see more than just the previous few words.
- Models need to have an understanding of the whole sentence or even the whole document.
-  The problem here is that language is complex.
-   In many languages, one word can have multiple meanings. These are homonyms.

> Transformers:

- can be scaled efficiently to use multi-core GPUs
-  it can parallel process input data
-   making use of much larger training datasets
-    it's able to learn to pay attention to the meaning of the words it's processing. And attention is all you need.

1. The Transformer model uses self-attention to compute representations of input sequences, which allows it to capture long-term dependencies and parallelize computation effectively.
2.  The authors demonstrate that their model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several machine translation tasks and outperforms previous models that rely on RNNs or CNNs.

 > The attention map:
 can be defined as the weights assigned to each input feature when computing the context vector. ex:  can be useful to illustrate the attention weights between each word and every other word.


>  Self-attention: is a mechanism that allows the model to capture relationships between different positions of the input sequence. Self-attention is particularly useful in capturing long-range dependencies and identifying important elements within the sequence.


 self-attention and the ability to learn a tension in this way across the whole input significantly approve the model's ability to encode language.

Here's a simplified diagram of the transformer architecture so that you can focus at a high level on where these processes are taking place. The transformer architecture is split into two distinct parts, the encoder and the decoder. These components work in conjunction with each other and they share a number of similarities. Also, note here, the diagram you see is derived from the original attention is all you need paper. Notice how the inputs to the model are at the bottom and the outputs are at the top, where possible we'll try to remain faithful to this throughout the course. Now, machine-learning models are just big statistical calculators and they work with numbers, not words. So before passing texts into the model to process, you must first tokenize the words. Simply put, this converts the words into numbers, with each number representing a position in a dictionary of all the possible words that the model can work with. You can choose from multiple tokenization methods. For example, token IDs matching two complete words, or using token IDs to represent parts of words. As you can see here. What's important is that once you've selected a tokenizer to train the model, you must use the same tokenizer when you generate text. Now that your input is represented as numbers, you can pass it to the embedding layer. This layer is a trainable vector embedding space, a high-dimensional space where each token is represented as a vector and occupies a unique location within that space. Each token ID in the vocabulary is matched to a multi-dimensional vector, and the intuition is that these vectors learn to encode the meaning and context of individual tokens in the input sequence. Embedding vector spaces have been used in natural language processing for some time, previous generation language algorithms like Word2vec use this concept. Don't worry if you're not familiar with this. You'll see examples of this throughout the course, and there are some links to additional resources in the reading exercises at the end of this week. Looking back at the sample sequence, you can see that in this simple case, each word has been matched to a token ID, and each token is mapped into a vector. In the original transformer paper, the vector size was actually 512, so much bigger than we can fit onto this image. For simplicity, if you imagine a vector size of just three, you could plot the words into a three-dimensional space and see the relationships between those words. You can see now how you can relate words that are located close to each other in the embedding space, and how you can calculate the distance between the words as an angle, which gives the model the ability to mathematically understand language. As you add the token vectors into the base of the encoder or the decoder, you also add positional encoding. The model processes each of the input tokens in parallel. So by adding the positional encoding, you preserve the information about the word order and don't lose the relevance of the position of the word in the sentence. Once you've summed the input tokens and the positional encodings, you pass the resulting vectors to the self-attention layer. Here, the model analyzes the relationships between the tokens in your input sequence. As you saw earlier, this allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence to better capture the contextual dependencies between the words. The self-attention weights that are learned during training and stored in these layers reflect the importance of each word in that input sequence to all other words in the sequence. But this does not happen just once, the transformer architecture actually has multi-headed self-attention. This means that multiple sets of self-attention weights or heads are learned in parallel independently of each other. The number of attention heads included in the attention layer varies from model to model, but numbers in the range of 12-100 are common. The intuition here is that each self-attention head will learn a different aspect of language. For example, one head may see the relationship between the people entities in our sentence. Whilst another head may focus on the activity of the sentence. Whilst yet another head may focus on some other properties such as if the words rhyme. It's important to note that you don't dictate ahead of time what aspects of language the attention heads will learn. The weights of each head are randomly initialized and given sufficient training data and time, each will learn different aspects of language. While some attention maps are easy to interpret, like the examples discussed here, others may not be. Now that all of the attention weights have been applied to your input data, the output is processed through a fully-connected feed-forward network. The output of this layer is a vector of logits proportional to the probability score for each and every token in the tokenizer dictionary. You can then pass these logits to a final softmax layer, where they are normalized into a probability score for each word. This output includes a probability for every single word in the vocabulary, so there's likely to be thousands of scores here. One single token will have a score higher than the rest. This is the most likely predicted token. But as you'll see later in the course, there are a number of methods that you can use to vary the final selection from this vector of probabilities.
