<br>its performance wasn't getting that much better if we were training small AI models.

**LLMs**

large language model are built by using supervised learning to repeatedly predict the next word.
<br>
LLMs not just predict the next word, but actually learn to follow instructions and also be safe in what it outputs.<br>
But at the heart of LLMs is this technology that's learned from a lot of data to predict what is the next word. That's how large language models work;
**they're trained to repeatedly predict the next word.**

<br>
LLMs are giving a new way to find information
<br>
LLM can sometimes make facts up. We call this hallucination.
<br>

AI is a general-purpose technology. 
<br>
ex of tasks LLMs can carry out:
1. writting
2. reading => looking at a relatively long piece of text
3. chatting

<br>
two differnt types of LLM-based application:<br>

    -web interface-based application
    -software-based application
